# Case_Studies
Projects on different Case Studies

### Project 1:
#### Credit Case Study:
- Done Exploratory Data Analysis on the data to create inferences about the data for the companies to give loan to applicants.
- In this we used Python and its different libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn for Exploratory Data Analysis.
- Started with the data cleaning and understanding the data.
- Followed with finding the outliers in the data and handling the missing values.
- Then started doing Univariate Analysis and Drawing correlation matrix.
- After this checked for variables for higher correlations so we can do Bivariate and Multivariate analysis and take some inferences.
- Created a porfolio with the inferences I got from the analysis and the visualizations.
#### Technologies Used:
- Python
- Libraries:
  - Numpy
  - Pandas
  - Seaborn
  - Matplotlib
